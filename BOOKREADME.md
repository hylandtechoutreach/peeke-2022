## Groups
Interns will be split into three groups.

### Green Group
The green group will work on going through the [Web 101](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-101) and [Web 102](https://hylandtechclub.com/web-102) Hy-Tech Club curriculum. They will also go through the [CS Fundamentals Express](https://studio.code.org/s/express-2021) curriculum from Code.org, and will hopefully be able to help facilitate some learning sessions.

### Blue Group
The blue group will work as a software development team with the goal of creating a Student Profile Database. The Hyland Tech Outreach team plans to use this web application to help keep track of students in a more sustainable way.

### Yellow Group
The yellow group will work as a software development team with the goal of creating a Universal Changing Table Locator application. We hope for this to become a real, legitimate app that can be used to help caregivers find changing tables wherever they are.

## Scheduling
There will be some important meetings to attend, either in-person or on Zoom. There will also be a lot of time spent working (aka "homework") that will not require any specific timing; the only necessity is that you reach **150 hours** for the internship.

## Intern Expectations
There are some basic expectations we hope all interns will be able to meet.

- Be flexible with us - this is the second time we have offered this internship!
- Attend all scheduled Zoom meetings or in-person meetings for your group
  - Please let us know if you have a conflict!
- Participate actively during group activities
- Complete any assigned "homework" independently
- Communicate professionally
  - Check your e-mail
  - Check Discord
  - Do not say anything inappropriate
- Reach out and ask for help if you need it
  - Let us know how you're feeling!

## Hours
Interns will be ultimately responsible for keeping track of their own hours, but the Tech Outreach team will need to verify them.

- Some of your hours will be "direct" - time spent in meetings with us
- Some of your hours will be "homework" that we expect you to complete on your own time
- You may also have "self-driven" hours - if you want to work more, do more research, learn more, etc
